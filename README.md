### INTRODUCTION
A crime is a form of violence or illegal act performed by perpertrator(s) against another in other to cause to person or property which is purnishable by the authority. Directly or indirectly, cime affects peoples lives. It is a major variable that affects the development of a country. Crimes in African nations keep rising which span from a range of violent and non-violent actions by political agents, including governments, rebels, militias, identity groups, political parties, external actors, rioters, protesters and civilians. The rate and fatalities of these crimes brought about Crime Analysis.

Crime Analysis is a systematic approach that identifies & analyzes patterns and trends in crime. This analysis includes, exploring & detecting crimes and identifying the relationships between these crimes with criminals. This process aims to extract meaningful information from a large dataset and to assist law enforcement agents to tackle and reduce crimes.


### PROBLEM STATEMENT

1. To analyze crime rates and fatalities in various African countries, as well as the variations among different actors and actor groups and their contributions to total crimes and fatalities recorded. 

2. To observe the impact of crime trend and pattern  in different region over the years from 1997 to 2023 (March 31st), and the factors that are most dominant or differ the most in the top 3 and bottom 3 countries in terms of crime rate.

3. Build a crime analytics and forecasting tool that assesses fatalities threat level based on disorder type, actor, and possible crime events, leveraging insights from historical data to inform preemptive policy decisions.

### ABOUT THE DATASET

This dataset contains codes reported information on political violence, demonstrations (rioting and protesting) and select non-violent, politically important events. It aims to capture the modes, frequency and intensity of crimes and it's fatalities on all African countries from 1997 to March, 2013.

These crime data contains:
- Dates and locations of conflict events;
- Specific types of events including battles, civilian killings, riots, protests and recruitment activities;
- Events by a range of actors, including rebels, governments, militias, armed groups, protesters and civilians;
- Changes in territorial control; and
- Reported fatalities

Recorded in 315940 Rows and, 31 Columns

**Data Collection**

This, was the first attack on the dataset. We employed the use of some functions like shape, head, describe, info, columns to ascertain the core feature and its relatives. To further ensure that our data will be ready to be used, we cleaned up the data by removing duplicates, dropping irrelevant rows & columns.

**Data Preparation**

The process of selecting data for modeling starts here. The Prediction Target after analysis was Fatality and the Feature Series are Event_Type, Sub_Event_Type, Inter1, Regions, Country, Year.
